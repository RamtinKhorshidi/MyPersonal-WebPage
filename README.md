# Ramtin Khorshidi - Personal Portfolio

A cinematic, high-performance personal portfolio website showcasing my dual journey as a Front-End Developer and Actor/Performer. Built with modern web technologies to deliver an immersive usage experience.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Core**: React, TypeScript, Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 (Custom Configuration)
- **Animation**: Framer Motion (Complex transitions, Parallax, sequenced reveals)
- **Routing**: React Router DOM (with `AnimatePresence` page transitions)
- **State**: React Context API (Theme Management)

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎨 Dynamic Theme System
- **Dual Aesthetic**: Switches seamlessly between two professionally curated palettes.
  - **Dark Mode (Default)**: Federal Blue (`#0e0e52`), Pumpkin (`#fe7f2d`), and Egyptian Blue (`#28369e`).
  - **Light Mode**: Warm Cream, Madder Red, and Sunset Gold.
- **Persistent Preference**: Remembers user choice via `localStorage` and respects system default.
- **Animated Toggle**: Custom morphing Sun/Moon animation with particle effects (stars/clouds).

### 🎬 Cinematic Motion
- **Page Transitions**: Smooth cross-dissolve and blur effects between routes.
- **Scroll Parallax**: Background gradients move at different speeds for depth.
- **Staggered Reveals**: Content cascades in elegantly rather than loading abruptly.
- **Custom Typography Animation**: "Creative Journey" title features a Splitting.js integration with physics-based SVG interactions.
- **3D Flip Toggles**: Custom CSS 3D transforms for the theme switcher.
- **Ghost Spirit Animation**: A playful, CSS-only floating spirit that traverses the homepage with randomized vertical positioning and blend-mode interactions.

### 📱 Responsive Design
- Fully responsive layout optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Adaptive navigation with mobile drawer menu and blurry backdrop support.
- **Expanding Gallery**: An interactive, accordion-style image gallery in the Acting section that expands cards on click/tap, optimized for both desktop (horizontal) and mobile (vertical) layouts.
- **Showcase Cards**: Dedicated "Foreign Homeland" feature card with interactive hover states.

### ⚡ Performance
- **Image Optimization**: Automated script (`scripts/optimize-images.cjs`) converts assets to WebP and resizes them.
- **Lazy Loading**: Integrated throughout the gallery for faster initial page loads.
